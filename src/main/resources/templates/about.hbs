    <h1>WELCOME TO HERO SQUAD</h1>

    <p>Hero Squad is an app that allows you to create any heroes of your choice and add these heroes to a squad with a mission.</p>

    <p>You can create as many heroes and squads as you like but note that any hero you create cannot belong to more than one squad.</p>

    <p>You may also add any number of heroes in your squad but the number you set cannot be altered and hence the number of heroes in your squad cannot exceed the number that you set.</p>

    <p>You may require more heroes in your squad than is available and in this case you will be prompted to create more heroes first.</p>

    <p>Now you are ALL SET!</p>
